# Wanna play agaisnt friends but no way to set it up? Want to build a gaming community?

Hi there. I'm Tweeno and I've developed a Matchmaking/Pugs/Scrims bot that can be used in any discord.

The bot creates teams of 3 or 5, randomized, with random captains or even Pre made teams.
The bot comes with its own Leaderboard, based on a mmr system.

## How to play ?
Once enough players have queued up using the correct command, the bot will ask you to pick between random teams or captain mode.

The bot will then create the teams and 2 different voice chats for each team to join.
Then you play the game, as a normal private game.

Once the game has been completed, one player reports a win or loss to the bot. the bot will then automaticly give or take mmr from each player, dependent on wich team they were on, if abused, admins can revert the game.

All commands can be seen using !helpsolosmatchmaking or !helpteammatchmaking

Hope you enjoy the bot. If you need any help feel free to use the !credits command to either report issues on my github or send me a pm on discord with questions, as i'll be there to answer any questions you may have.
